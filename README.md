**lolPy is not currently being updated; if a large number of people come and want to see this API tool be kept up-to-date and supported, I will revisit it.**

To use lolPy, you must first create an instance of `RiotApiClient`, which requires an API key from [RiotGames](https://developer.riotgames.com/) and which region you'd like to begin work in. This region can change at any time by using `change_region`, which resets all region-specific data to their default values.

Example:  
`1. list_of_summoner_names = ['Dyrus', 'hi im gosu']`  
`2. key = 'this-is-an-example'`  
`3. client = RiotApiClient(key, Region.na)  # Region.na evaluates to 'na'`  
`4. summoner = client.search(list_of_summoner_names)  # search returns the first summoner in the list of search results; these are stored in RiotApiClient.summoners`  
`5. print(summoner.name)`  
`6.    >> 'Dyrus'`  
`7. summoner = client.next()`  
`8. print(summoner.name)`  
`9.    >> 'hi im gosu'`  
`10. match_history = client.ranked_match_history()  # returns last 10 ranked games for hi im gosu in a list`  
`11. # what are the attributes stored in match_history[0]??`  
`12. print(match_history[0].get_data_members())`  
`13.    >> ['matchType', 'matchVersion', 'region', 'matchId', 'season', 'matchDuration', 'platformId', 'mapId', 'participants', 'matchCreation', 'queueType', 'participantIdentities', 'matchMode']`  
`14. client.next()  # client will loop back to the beginning of the list once the end has been hit`  
`15. print(client.current_summoner.name)`  
`16.   >> 'Dyrus'`  



For more on how to use lolPy, see the Wiki page for [`RiotApiClient`](https://github.com/p-ob/lolPy/wiki/RiotApiClient) and the other Wiki pages.

lolPy requires [restPy](https://github.com/p-ob/restPy/) to function in the new version. restPy requires [xmltodict](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict).

For actual implementation, see [lolAnalyzer](https://github.com/p-ob/lolAnalyzer), a tool I'm working on to analyze and store player performance in League of Legends.
